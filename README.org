#+TITLE: CS331 Programming Assignments

* Lab Submission

Welcome to *CS 331: Data Structures and Algorithms*!

You will be using github to submit all lab assignments for this class. Labs will be added to the github repository we created for you. For the deadlines for assignments please see http://www.cs.iit.edu/~glavic/cs331/2021-spring/labs/.

* Notebooks

For your convenience we also include notebook templates and the notebooks completed in class here. Please do not modify these notebooks directly in the repository because I will be updating them over time. Just create a copy of these folders and then modify them as you please.
